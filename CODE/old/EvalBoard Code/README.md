# Pixels Camp PCB Badge

## Info
This is a PCB badge for the 2019 edition of pixels camp. The project consists on a 39x9 (351) LED matrix display driven by the IS31FL3741 IC and controlled by an ESP32, making it wifi-connected. The board can be powered by usb and/or a 1s lipo battery (charges with usb).

The main goal is to make a web connected scrolling text display, although anyone can develop a custom version of the firmware.

**Special thanks to ISSI for supporting the project by supplying a devboard for the IS31FL3741 IC, much apreciated!**

## Updates


### Latest Updates
* Working on the firmware (freeRTOS?)
* Working on new control board design


### Known Bugs
* Swapped pins on the regulator footprint
    * Fixed in new version (added an aditional regulator)
* USB-to-Serial (CH340G) needs external oscillator

### TODO
* Fix bugs
* (Add a boot switch for convinience)
* Test LED Matrix with devboard



## Circuit and PCB

### Circuit

#### Power
Power is supplied by usb and/or 1s lipo, with usb charging capabilities.

The circuit can be powered by usb and/or 1s lipo. T1 is disabled when usb is present and vice-versa. There is also a main power switch that toggles T2.
An LTSpice simulation is present in the [Simulations](https://github.com/afonsus1997/Pixels-Camp-PCB-Badge/tree/master/PCB%20ESP32/Simulations) folder.


Used ICs:
* Voltage Regulator: NCP708
    * [Datasheet](https://www.onsemi.com/pub/Collateral/NCP708-D.PDF)
* Lipo charger: MCP73831T-2ADI/OT
    * [Datasheet](https://www.sparkfun.com/datasheets/Prototyping/Batteries/MCP73831T.pdf)




#### Digital and logic
The microcontroller used is the ESP32 with WIFI and bluetooth built-in. The LED matrix is driven by the IS31FL3741 IC. The usb to serial conversion in handled by the CH340G (with auto-reset DTR capabilities).

Used ICs:
* uC: ESP32

### PCBs
The PCBs was designed in Altium Designer and the most recent GERBERs and schematics are available in their respective repo folders. The Badge consists of 2 stackable PCBs, one for the matrix and one for the power and logic. Each PCB is 126x36mm and there is a panel PCB with both of the PCBs held by cuttable tabs. The panel is 140x91mm.
